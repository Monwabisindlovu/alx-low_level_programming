#0x14. C - Bit Manipulation
#This project focuses on learning about bit manipulation and bitwise operators in the C programming language.
#It contains several tasks that involve working with binary numbers, setting, clearing,
#and getting bits at specific positions, and checking the endianness of the system.

#Learning Objectives
#At the end of this project, you will be able to:

#Understand how to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators in C.
#Learn how to convert binary numbers to unsigned integers.
#Print the binary representation of a number without using arrays or malloc.
#Set, clear, and get bits at specific positions in a number.
#Calculate the number of bits that need to be flipped to get from one number to another.
#Check the endianness of the system.
#Requirements
#All code is written in C and compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc.
#The code must adhere to the Betty style guide.
#No more than 5 functions per file are allowed.
#The only allowed C standard library functions are malloc, free, and exit. No other functions like printf or puts are allowed.
#The prototypes of all functions and the _putchar function should be included in the main.h header file.
